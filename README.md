# *Quasar*<br/>Fibers, Channels and Actors for the JVM - Fat JAR

## Getting started

Install Gradle, then this will build the fat JARs (both normal and JDK8-optimised) in `build/lib` and run a test using the most appropriate one for your current JDK (`--info` is useful to see the output as well as the test JVM launch command line ):

`gradle --info`
